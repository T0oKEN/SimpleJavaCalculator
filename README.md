# SimpleJavaFXCalculator
Most simple java calculator (W.I.P.)
This is just my little project to show, what i am capable off. You shouldn't use this as it is because it doesn't have best solutions to problems I have experienced.

To do list
1. Make all buttons work
   - Currently not working 7/24
2. Make a nice design with interactive buttons
   - Currently it is just simple dark so my eyes doesn't burn from default white
3. Make some code optimalizations in the end
   - Currently it is mess with all that comes to my mind
